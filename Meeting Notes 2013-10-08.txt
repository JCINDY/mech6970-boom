Attendance:

11:20 am
General Guidelines

  - All code for each project will be kept in project specific folders
    - (i.e., lab2 code and all it's dependencies will be kept in the lab2 folder)
    - this is the shitty way. 
    - if someone is missing a dependency, alert the group.
      - It will be added to the folder. This will have to be done for each assignment.

  - Data files used need to be the same.
    - We will use the file parsed by read_async_log.m (`Novatel_Data.mat`)
    - This will stay in the `data/` directory so that it doesn't get changed.
    - Online ephemeris
      - code exists to download it, but we want to go ahead and have a single 
        version of each ephem file that gets version controlled. 
      - this will stay in the `data/` directory

  - Platform Independence
    - `filesep` command should be used for all directory strings
    - Under no circumstances should *.exe's be called

  - Don't be an asshole.
  - Write good code.
  - Use branches. Merge with the afflicted party present. 
      -If you don't know how to use git, learn.


Lab 3
  
  We will aim to complete the assignment by the date specified in the assignment,
  even though it will probably be moved.

  - Work Load Distribution
    - Everyone will work on Part I for the time being. We will reconvene to discuss
    working on Part II
    - Part I should be done by Mon 2013-10-14
